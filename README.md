## Project Overview
In this project, we explore the communication networks within urban, suburban, and rural communities across three 
US Midwest counties. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we simulate the diffusion of information over time, examining both 
disaster scenarios and normal situations. Our focus is on understanding how information spreads within these
communities by analyzing the influence of various sources, including online social networks, local news,
government sources, mainstream media, and print media. By studying the interactions of these information channels,
we aim to gain insights into the dynamics of information diffusion among individuals.
